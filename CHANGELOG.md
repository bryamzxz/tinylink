## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **ts2021 wire format corrected against upstream.** Initial implementation
  put the Noise IK msg1 in the HTTP body and used a 4-byte invented frame
  header. After cross-checking `tailscale/control/controlbase/messages.go`,
  `controlhttp/client.go`, and `control/ts2021/conn.go`:
  - The 101-byte initiation frame now travels base64-encoded in
    `X-Tailscale-Handshake`, with `Content-Length: 0` on the upgrade.
  - Initiation header is 5 bytes (`BE16 version || type(1) || BE16 len`);
    all subsequent records are 3 bytes (`type(1) || BE16 len`).
  - Frame types pinned to `1=initiation / 2=response / 3=error / 4=record`.
  - Noise prologue is the **string** `"Tailscale Control Protocol v1"`,
    not the byte `0x01` (that byte appears only in the cleartext header).
  - Optional EarlyPayload sentinel (`"\xff\xff\xffTS"` + BE32 len + JSON)
    is drained and discarded; upstream never acts on it either.
- **`/machine/register` body fixes.** `Version` changed from `100` to `1`
  (the Noise transport `CapabilityVersion`, not a marketing version);
  `NLKey` added as required `"nlpub:" + 64 zeros` (TKA disabled);
  `NodeKeySignature` removed (only set for TKA pre-auth flows upstream).

### Changed
- **Milestone 1 redefined.** The original M1 was "static WireGuard against a
  fixed peer + TMP117 telemetry over UDP." It is now "ts2021 control plane:
  the device registers with `controlplane.tailscale.com` and shows up in the
  Tailscale admin panel as an online node." There is no data plane in the
  new M1 — that returns in M2 alongside MapResponse.
- Roadmap shifted: M2 = MapRequest streaming + WireGuard data plane,
  M3 = DISCO + TMP117 telemetry, M4 = STUN, M5 = DERP, M6 = hardening.

### Added
- `tinylink` core component now contains the real M1 implementation:
  - Vendored crypto: BLAKE2s (RFC 7693), HMAC-BLAKE2s + HKDF, Curve25519
    (TweetNaCl-derived placeholder, swap with constant-time donna for
    production), Salsa20/HSalsa20/XSalsa20, NaCl-box.
  - Noise IK state machine (`Noise_IK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s`).
  - ts2021 client: TLS to control plane, HTTP/1.1 Upgrade with the
    initiation frame in `X-Tailscale-Handshake`, controlbase 5/3-byte
    framing, post-handshake EarlyPayload drain.
  - HTTP/2 client over the Noise channel via nghttp2
    (`espressif/nghttp`), with HPACK dynamic-table disabled.
  - Control plane public key bootstrap with NVS pinning.
  - `RegisterRequest` builder + response parser.
- `tools/credentials.csv.example` simplified to the M1 set
  (`wifi_ssid`, `wifi_pass`, `auth_key`).

### Removed
- `main/app_wireguard.{c,h}`, `main/app_sensor.{c,h}`,
  `main/app_telemetry.{c,h}`. These return in M2/M3.
- WireGuard-specific entries in `sdkconfig.defaults`.
- `examples/milestone1_static_wg/`, `examples/milestone1_tailscale_peer/`.
  Replaced by `examples/milestone1_register/`.
