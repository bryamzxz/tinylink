## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Milestone 1 redefined.** The original M1 was "static WireGuard against a
  fixed peer + TMP117 telemetry over UDP." It is now "ts2021 control plane:
  the device registers with `controlplane.tailscale.com` and shows up in the
  Tailscale admin panel as an online node." There is no data plane in the
  new M1 — that returns in M2 alongside MapResponse.
- Roadmap shifted: M2 = MapRequest streaming + WireGuard data plane,
  M3 = DISCO + TMP117 telemetry, M4 = STUN, M5 = DERP, M6 = hardening.

### Added
- `tinylink` core component now contains the real M1 implementation:
  - Vendored crypto: BLAKE2s (RFC 7693), HMAC-BLAKE2s + HKDF, Curve25519
    (TweetNaCl-derived placeholder, swap with constant-time donna for
    production), Salsa20/HSalsa20/XSalsa20, NaCl-box.
  - Noise IK state machine (`Noise_IK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s`).
  - ts2021 client: TLS to control plane, HTTP/1.1 Upgrade, framed Noise
    transport records.
  - Control plane public key bootstrap with NVS pinning.
  - `RegisterRequest` builder + response parser.
- `tools/credentials.csv.example` simplified to the M1 set
  (`wifi_ssid`, `wifi_pass`, `auth_key`).

### Removed
- `main/app_wireguard.{c,h}`, `main/app_sensor.{c,h}`,
  `main/app_telemetry.{c,h}`. These return in M2/M3.
- WireGuard-specific entries in `sdkconfig.defaults`.
- `examples/milestone1_static_wg/`, `examples/milestone1_tailscale_peer/`.
  Replaced by `examples/milestone1_register/`.
